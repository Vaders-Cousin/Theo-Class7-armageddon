Ready to Suffer? —here’s the next realism bump for Lab 1C-Bonus-D:
  1) Zone apex (chewbacca-growl.com) ALIAS → ALB
  2) ALB access logs → S3 bucket (with the required bucket policy)
  3) A couple of verification commands students can run to prove it’s working

Add this as bonus_b_logging_route53_apex.tf (or append to your existing Route53/logging file).

Add variables (append to variables.tf)
variable "enable_alb_access_logs" {
  description = "Enable ALB access logging to S3."
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "alb_access_logs_prefix" {
  description = "S3 prefix for ALB access logs."
  type        = string
  default     = "alb-access-logs"
}

Add file: bonus_b_logging_route53_apex.tf
